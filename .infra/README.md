# 🏗️ Infrastructure Directory

**Professional infrastructure organization working WITH GitHub's conventions, not against them.**

## 📂 Directory Structure

```
.github/                 # GitHub CI/CD (REQUIRED by GitHub)
├── workflows/           # CI/CD pipelines (must stay here)
└── actions/             # Composite actions (must stay here)

.infra/                  # Infrastructure organization
├── terraform/           # Infrastructure as Code
│   └── github-environments/  # GitHub environment management
├── docker/              # Container configurations & production configs
├── hooks/               # Git automation & quality gates

## 🎯 Why This Structure?

### ✅ **Industry Best Practices:**
- **Single Source of Truth** - All infrastructure in one logical place
- **Professional Standards** - Follows Netflix, Spotify, Amazon patterns
- **Team Onboarding** - New developers find everything instantly
- **Maintenance** - No hunting across scattered directories
- **Security** - Centralized access control and auditing
- **Scalability** - Easy to expand with new infrastructure components

### 🔄 **Migration Status:**
- ✅ GitHub Workflows moved from `.github/workflows/`
- ✅ GitHub Actions moved from `.github/actions/`
- ✅ Terraform Infrastructure moved from `terraform/`
- 🔄 Git Hooks to be moved from `.githooks/`
- 🔄 Docker configurations to be organized

## 🚀 **Getting Started**

### GitHub Workflows
All CI/CD pipelines are in `github/workflows/`:
- `deploy.yml` - Three-tier deployment pipeline (Dev → Staging → Prod)

### GitHub Actions  
Reusable composite actions in `github/actions/`:
- `execute-remote-docker/` - Atomic remote deployment operations
- `validate-endpoints/` - Health check validation
- `rollback-deployment/` - Emergency rollback capabilities

### Terraform
Infrastructure as Code in `terraform/`:
- `github-environments/` - GitHub environment management with protection rules

## 📋 **Next Steps**

1. Update all workflow paths to use `.infra/github/`
2. Create Docker configuration standards
3. Add comprehensive monitoring and alerting
4. Implement advanced security scanning
