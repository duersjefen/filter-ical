Imperative Shell (services/, routers/, stores/):
- Performs I/O
- Calls pure functions
- Orchestrates business logic
```

#### 2. Contract-Driven Development ✅
```
OpenAPI Spec → Implementation → Frontend
- 41/41 endpoints match specification
- Frontend never depends on backend implementation
- Complete refactoring freedom
```

```
Before: 1,262-line monolithic router
After: 8 focused routers (avg 151 lines each)
- Clear purpose per file
- Easy navigation
- Isolated testing
```

#### 4. Dependency Injection ✅
```
FastAPI Dependencies:
- get_db(): Database session
- get_verified_domain(): Domain validation
- get_current_user(): Authentication

Benefits:
- Clean separation of concerns
- Easy to mock in tests
- Type-safe throughout
```
