Improve recurring events selection within groups, as this is almost the most important functionality for the users; the UI/UX must be perfect.
Fix Filter creation, it should save selected groups and selected events to the backend. And show the same overview as in "Create new filtered calender", instead of "All events".

Fix ICAl link creation.
Add admin panel for events -> group assignments.
Fix rules for DCG Events and BCC Events
